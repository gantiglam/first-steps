# first-steps
As a my "first-step" apllication I've made a simple console game - H A N G M A N.
Player must guess a hidden word by inputing a letters from keyboard.
If the letter is from the word it'being showed on its place,
if not - the gallows rises one step higher, up to the "game-over" condition.
